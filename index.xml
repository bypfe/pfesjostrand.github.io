      <description>About me. Another guy from Sweden. Online I generally go by PFE, pfesjostrand, or some variation of that. My education is in political science (+ some economics and statistics and quite a bit of practical philosophy). I also have extensive practical experience in politics, mainly as a local organizer - on a volunteer basis - for Sweden’s social-democratic party. While I am no longer active in a party, politics in different ways is still a significant interest that I try to find ways to feed.</description>

This Hugo theme was ported from Ivy, a minimalist website generator built in Python. I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to document this theme. You have to read the source code to understand what it can do. All I can say for now is that I love it. It is clean, minimal, and responsive.
I hope you will enjoy this theme. The source code is on Github. Happy hacking!</description>

      <description>This website was created using the R package blogdown by Yihu Xie. Blogdown is cool becuase it allows easy use of Rmarkdown in the site, which basically means you can embed R code in the site, this is basically quite awesome if you want to discuss and showcase data analysis online. Since I am to impatient to tinker with site themes for the sake of being ‘unique’ it also uses an excellent minimialist theme, hugo-ivy, which was ported by Yihu Xie to Hugo and blogdown from the static website generator Ivy.</description>
