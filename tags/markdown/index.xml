      <description>This website was created using the R package blogdown by Yihu Xie. Blogdown is cool becuase it allows easy use of Rmarkdown in the site, which basically means you can embed R code in the site, this is basically quite awesome if you want to discuss and showcase data analysis online. Since I am to impatient to tinker with site themes for the sake of being ‘unique’ it also uses an excellent minimialist theme, hugo-ivy, which was ported by Yihu Xie to Hugo and blogdown from the static website generator Ivy.</description>
